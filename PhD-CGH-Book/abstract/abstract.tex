\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

Autonomous driving is considered one of the greatest technological challenges today. When autonomous cars take over our roads, accidents will be significantly reduced, almost disappearing, as the technology will be tested and will not violate driving regulations, among other social and economic benefits.

One of the most critical aspects on developing an autonomous vehicle is perceiving and understanding the surrounding scene. This task must be as accurate and efficient as possible to predict the future of the scene and assist in decision-making. In this way, the actions taken by the vehicle will ensure the safety of the vehicle itself and its occupants, as well as that of surrounding obstacles such as pedestrians, other vehicles, or road infrastructure.

In this context, this doctoral thesis focuses on the study and development of different predictive techniques for scene understanding in the context of autonomous driving. Throughout the thesis, there is a progressive incorporation of Deep Learning techniques into the proposed algorithms to improve reasoning about what is happening in the traffic scenario and model the complex interactions between social information (different participants or agents in the scene, such as vehicles, cyclists, or pedestrians) and physical information (\ie \ geometric, semantic, and topological information from the high-definition map) present in the scene.

The perception layer of an autonomous vehicle is modularly divided into three stages: Detection, Tracking, and Prediction. To start studying the monitoring and prediction stages, a Multi-Object Tracking algorithm based on classical motion estimation and association techniques is proposed and validated on the KITTI dataset, which has state-of-the-art metrics. Furthermore, the use of an intelligent filter based on contextual map information is proposed, aiming to monitor the most relevant agents in the scene over time. These filtered agents serve as the preliminary input for making uni-modal predictions based on a kinematic model. CARLA, one of the most promising hyper-realistic simulators for autonomous driving, is used to validate this intelligent filter proposal. It demonstrates how using contextual map information can significantly reduce the inference time for tracking and prediction by focusing on the truly relevant agents in the traffic scenario.

After observing the limitations of a kinematics-based prediction model for long-term agent prediction, the different algorithms in the thesis focus on the prediction module using the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. These datasets assume that the agents provided in each traffic scenario have already been monitored for a certain number of observations.

Firstly, a model based on recurrent neural networks (particularly Long-Short Term Memory networks) and attention mechanism is introduced to encode the past trajectories of agents. It also uses a simplified representation of the map in the form of potential final positions on the road to calculate uni-modal future trajectories. These components are wrapped in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, achieving metrics similar to the state-of-the-art in the uni-modal case.

Once the previous model is validated on Argoverse 1, different precise and efficient base models are proposed for the prediction module. These models incorporate social information, map information, and a final improvement based on a Transformer encoder and 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks. They introduce the use of graph networks (particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, GCNs) to encode the interactions between agents and preprocess preliminary trajectories from the map using a heuristic method. These models predict different multimodal future trajectories, covering various possible futures for the agent of interest. The proposed base models achieve state-of-the-art regression metrics in both multimodal and unimodal cases while maintaining a clear efficiency compromise compared to other proposals.

The final model of the thesis, inspired by the previous models and validated on the most recent dataset for autonomous driving prediction algorithms (Argoverse 2), incorporates topological and semantic information of the preliminary future lanes using the aforementioned heuristic method. It uses map encoding based on Deep Learning with Graph Convolutional Networks, a fusion cycle of physical and social features, Deep Learning aggregation of surrounding environment, and a refinement module to enhance the quality of the final multimodal predictions in an elegant and efficient manner. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our method achieves prediction metrics on par with the top-ranked methods in the Argoverse 2 Leaderboard while significantly reducing the number of parameters and floating-point operations per second.

Finally, this final model is validated in simulation in various autonomous driving applications, such as decision-making in the SMARTS simulator or domain adaptation study in the hyper-realistic CARLA simulator, involving other vehicle layers as a preliminary step towards its implementation in a real autonomous vehicle.
