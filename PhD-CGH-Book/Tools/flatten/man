.TH FLATTEN 1 "29 October 1995"
.SH NAME
flatten \- recursively include files into a LaTeX source file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B flatten
[
.I options
]
.IR infile 
.IR outfile
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B flatten
takes a LaTeX source file
.I infile
and recursively inserts the text of any files that
.I infile
`includes'. The result is written to file
.I outfile
which then consists of a single LaTeX source file.
Note that
.I infile
must be the complete name of the LaTeX source file
including the extension (e.g., root.tex).
.PP
When
.B flatten
finds an inclusion command it searches for the file
to be included. If it finds it, it writes the
file at the appropriate place in the
.I outfile
file, commenting out the inclusion command itself.
An included file is terminated either by the TeX
command \\endinput or the physical
end of the file, whichever occurs first.
If the file for inclusion is not found, an error is reported but
processing continues.
.PP
.B Flatten
automatically produces an error log file called
.I flatten.err
which is available for examination after each run.
.PP
For more information see the manual: Peter Wilson,
"FLaTTeN: A Program to Flatten LaTeX Source Files",
the source for which should be in directory DOCUMENTDIR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d num
Print diagnostic information to the error file
.I flatten.err.
A value of
.I 1
will print diagnostics related to file searching,
while a value of 
.I 2
or more will print full diagnostics.
.TP
.B -f name
File inclusion commands will be read from file
.IR name. 
By default, 
.B flatten
recognizes the LaTeX commands \\input and \\include
as inclusion commands. When this option is used
the default inclusion commands are replaced by
the commands in the
.I name
file. The desired inclusion commands must be listed in
.I name
with one command per line and no blank lines. For example,
if the desired inclusion commands are \\input and \\infile
but excluding \\include, then the 
.I name
file will contain:
.EX 4
.IP
\\input
.br
\\infile
.br
.EE
.TP
.B -D character
The
.I character
the operating system uses for catenating directory names when
forming a pathname.
The default is the slash (/) character.
.TP
.B -P characters
The
.I characters
the operating system uses when seperating pathnames in a list of
pathnames. The default characters are space ( ), colon (:) and
semi-colon (;). The space is always set as one of the 
.IR characters.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B Flatten 
searches for files in the directories in the paths defined by
the FLATINPUTS environment variable. If this variable is not
set then it only searches in the current directory. Note that
.I infile
is always assumed to be located in the current directory.
